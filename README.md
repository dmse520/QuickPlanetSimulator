# QuickPlanetSimulator
This is my simple program to simulate planet orbiting the Sun

This program simulates planets orbiting the Sun with use of numeric methods. Planets have near-real life values. Whole world is rendered with Direct2D (scale of the world can be changed by mouse wheel). IDE used is Visual Studio.
